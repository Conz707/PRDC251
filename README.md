2nd Year Group Project

Grade Achieved: 63%

This project was undertaken as part of a second year group project module, in which myself and 2 others worked on eliciting requirements
from Llechfan Hostel on the needs of the system we were developing, and then using ASP.NET to create the Hostel Booking System and
accompanying database.
